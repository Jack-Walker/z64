Usage
  Command line
    Format:
      python z64porter.py [OOT DEBUG ROM] [DECOMPRESSED MM US ROM] [SCENE TO REPLACE] [SCENE TO PORT] <OPTIONS>

    Options: (All are optional)
      -m MUSIC	  Music value. Prefix with 0x if hex.
      -o OFFSET	  Offset to insert your port at. Assumeed hex; 0x optional
      -s	  Operate in safe mode (Don't port actors/objects)
      -q	  Quiet mode (Don't output messages)
   
    Examples:
      python z64porter.py ZELOOTMA.z64 MM_DEC.z64 109 35
        This would port scene 35 from MM (Termina feild) to scene 109 of OoT (Chest test area), at the offset
        it finds, porting actors, and outputting status messages.
      python z64porter.py ZELOOTMA.z64 MM_DEC.z64 109 12 -s -q -o 0x35D0000
        This would port scene 9 from MM (Ikana canyon) to scene 109 of OoT (Chest test area), at 0x35D0000,
        skipping map actors, and not outputting status messages.
  GUI
    Run z64porter-gui.py and give it what it asks for. If and when you give it your own offset, do not prefix
    with a "0x"
  NOTE
    You cannot port over all scenes. Try using debug room scenes (scene 109, map select 119 is my favorite)

That's all! Enjoy :)
