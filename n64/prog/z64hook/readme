OVERVIEW
 z64hook is a package set up to help load binaries into Ocarina of Time: Master Quest's
 debugger's ROM, though it could be adapted to work with other N64 games.
 
FILES
 z64hook-0.0.0.ppf	- depreciated
 z64hook-0.0.1.ppf	- depreciated
 z64hook-0.0.2.ppf	- current. Applying this patch to a MQ Debug ROM puts all of the
                  	  assembled contents of file 'asm' into ROM.
 asm			- Assembly behind z64hook. This patch makes a 4096 byte chunk of
                   	  ROM (offset 0x3600000) load into RAM at 0x80600000. It also
                   	  hooks the game into two spots of that data, one at 0x80600000,
                   	  and the other at 0x80600800. This can all be changed if desired,
                   	  see asm for ROM offsets of everything modified.
